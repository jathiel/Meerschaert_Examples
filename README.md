# Meerschaert Examples

This repository is a collection of Jupyter notebooks covering several of the examples that appear in the textbook [Mathematical Modeling](https://www.stt.msu.edu/users/mcubed/modeling.html) by [Meerschaert](https://www.stt.msu.edu/users/mcubed/index.html). This textbook is used by the [Department of Mathematics](http://www.citytech.cuny.edu/mathematics/) at [City Tech](http://www.citytech.cuny.edu) for three courses:

* MAT3770 Mathematical Modeling I - a course on sigle/multivariable optimization and linear programming (Ch. 1-3)
* MAT4880 Mathematical Modeling II - a course on discrete and continuous dynamical systems (Ch. 4-6)
* MAT3772 Stochastic Models - a course on probability, Markov chains, and Monte Carlo methods (Ch. 7-9)

This is a work in progress and may not cover every example from the text. The Jupyter notebooks shown here use either the [Python 3](https://www.python.org/) of [SageMath](https://www.sagemath.org/) kernels.
